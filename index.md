## CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Part 1 of lab 4 was my favorite to work through because of how challenging it was. Figuring out the run-time errors was difficult because the calculations for Julian Days were wrong due to mistyping the formula multiple times. Part 2 of the lab was also a challenge because I was unable to fix some errors but I liked this lab because it was the first and only time where we used truncating and "nan".
* Lab 10

    I liked lab 10 because this was the first lab that used a .h file which made the overall programming a lot smoother than others. I also liked part 3 a lot because the result was an image rather than text while part 2 was difficult because I had trouble getting the code to actually go through the long list of California counties correctly. Part 3 was the most difficult while part 1 was the easiest part of lab 10 and I liked both of them.
* Lab 12

    I really liked lab 12 because we used Graphics Magick for a GIF. Part 2 was fun since we used a random number generator to get the result and it was fairly similar to part 1. Overall, lab 12 was just a fun lab as opposed to being a difficult one.
