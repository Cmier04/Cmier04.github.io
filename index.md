# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Christine Mier and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

* Lab 4

    Part 1 of lab 4 was my favorite to work through because of how challenging it was. Figuring out the run-time errors was difficult because the calculations for Julian Days were wrong due to mistyping the formula multiple times. Part 2 of the lab was also a challenge because I was unable to fix some errors but I liked this lab because it was the first and only time where we used truncating and "nan".
* Lab 10

    I liked lab 10 because this was the first lab that used a .h file which made the overall programming a lot smoother than others. I also liked part 3 a lot because the result was an image rather than text while part 2 was difficult because I had trouble getting the code to actually go through the long list of California counties correctly. Part 3 was the most difficult while part 1 was the easiest part of lab 10 and I liked both of them.
* Lab 12

    I really liked lab 12 because we used Graphics Magick for a GIF. Part 2 was fun since we used a random number generator to get the result and it was fairly similar to part 1. Overall, lab 12 was just a fun lab as opposed to being a difficult one.

## CPSC 121
This class provided me with a lot of insight into object-oriented programming. As of right now files have been lost from this course.

## CPSC 131
The "Assignment 3 Stacks" repository belongs to this course but all other files need to be recovered. This course focused on data structures and taught me a lot about the subject which builds upon my foundation of knowledge and experience in Computer Science.

## CPSC 223
This Python course included assignments focused on applying our knowledge in object-oriented programming through Python programming and tested our troubleshooting abilities by ensuring students provided test cases wherever necessary.

## CPSC 240
I enjoyed this course a lot for its difficulty level and for how different it is compared to the others I have taken. This course introduces students to x86 assembly programming and provides a solid foundation for understanding how the hardware of our devices interacts with our software by teaching us how to store and utilize what is stored in various registers.
